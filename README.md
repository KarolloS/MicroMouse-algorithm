# MicroMouse algorithm
Implementation of [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://brilliant.org/wiki/bellman-ford-algorithm/) for maze solving robot. 
More about [MicroMouce competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse).

Repository contains two major files:
* `program.m` - finds the way between one corner and centre of two (`labirynt_1.mat`, `labirynt_2.mat`) hardcoded mazes.
* `symulator.m` - allows the user to create its own maze using very easy graphical interface, solve the maze step by step and perform
multiple "runs" through the maze in order to find the fastest way.
